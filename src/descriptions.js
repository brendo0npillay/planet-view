    name: "mercury",
    description:
      "Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun, with surface temperatures swinging from scorching hot to freezing cold due to its lack of atmosphere. Despite being so close to the Sun, it’s not the hottest planet — that title goes to Venus. A year on Mercury is just 88 Earth days, and one day lasts longer than its year. It has a massive iron core and barely any moons or atmosphere, making it a rocky, crater-filled world that looks like the Moon but with solar inferno vibes.",

  {
    name: "venus",
    description:
      "Venus has a thick toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, which traps heat and makes it the hottest planet in our system, even hotter than Mercury. Its surface can melt lead, and its clouds rain acid — definitely not vacation material. Venus spins backwards compared to most planets and rotates so slowly that one day lasts longer than its year. It’s often called Earth's sister planet because of its size and mass, but it’s more like Earth’s evil twin with its hellish conditions and volcanic chaos.",

    name: "earth",
    description:
      "Earth is the only known planet to support life, with liquid water, a breathable atmosphere, and a magnetic field that protects it from solar radiation. About 70% of Earth’s surface is covered in oceans, and it’s home to millions of species, including humans. It has one natural satellite — the Moon — which stabilizes its tilt and helps regulate tides. Earth's atmosphere contains the perfect mix of gases for life, and its distance from the Sun places it in the “Goldilocks zone” — not too hot, not too cold.",
  },
  {
    name: "mars",
    description:
      "Mars is known as the Red Planet because of iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It’s home to Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, a canyon system that dwarfs the Grand Canyon. Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, and signs that water once flowed on its surface. Scientists believe it may have once supported life, and rovers like Perseverance are currently exploring its dusty terrain for evidence. It has two tiny potato-shaped moons: Phobos and Deimos.",

  {
    name: "jupiter",
    description:
      "Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, a gas giant with over 300 times Earth's mass and a magnetic field so strong it could fry electronics from a distance. Its atmosphere features the Great Red Spot — a massive storm that’s been raging for centuries. Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including Europa, which may have an ocean beneath its icy crust that could harbor life. Its immense gravity helps protect Earth by pulling in comets and asteroids that might otherwise hit us.",

  {
    name: "saturn",
    description:
      "Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, made of ice and rock chunks ranging in size from grains to mountains. It’s a gas giant like Jupiter but less dense — it could float in water if you had a big enough bathtub. Saturn has more than 80 moons, with Titan being the most intriguing. Titan has lakes of methane and an atmosphere thicker than Earth’s, making it a prime target for future exploration. Saturn also has massive storms and hexagon-shaped cloud patterns at its poles.",

  {
    name: "uranus",
    description:
      "Uranus is the oddball of the Solar System — it rotates on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees, likely due to a massive collision in its past. It’s an ice giant with a bluish hue caused by methane in its atmosphere. Uranus has faint rings and at least 27 known moons, many named after characters from Shakespeare’s plays. It’s the coldest planet in the Solar System, with temperatures dropping to nearly -224°C, and it takes 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.",

  {
    name: "neptune",
    description:
      "Neptune is the furthest known planet from the Sun and is famous for its intense blue color, caused by methane in its atmosphere. It’s an ice giant with the strongest winds in the Solar System — some over 2,000 km/h. Neptune was the first planet discovered by mathematical prediction rather than direct observation. It has 14 known moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of the planet's spin and may be a captured object from the Kuiper Belt.",
